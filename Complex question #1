-- Find the cities with the highest population in each continent,
-- including the name of the continent, the name of the country, and the population of the city. --

-- utilized SUBQUERY and WINDOW FUNCTION --

-- Analyze each table --
SELECT * FROM city;
SELECT * FROM country;

-- analyze the joined table --
SELECT * FROM country c
JOIN city ct ON c.Code = ct.CountryCode;

-- created a SELECT statement with Window function 
-- this statement lets me select the required columns,
-- I ranked them using row_num and over
-- partitioned the row by continent and order by population of the city.

SELECT ct.name city, continent,
            c.name country,
            ct.population,
            row_number() OVER(partition by continent ORDER BY ct.population DESC) ctr
			FROM country c
			JOIN city ct ON c.Code = ct.CountryCode;

-- In this final query, I selected all from the subquery,
-- I dont know if I can simplify this even more, because the only thing that I added is WHERE clause at the end 
-- it can be =1 or < 1, both return the rank 1 in terms of population.

SELECT * FROM (
			SELECT ct.name city, continent,
            c.name country,
            ct.population,
            row_number() OVER(partition by continent ORDER BY ct.population DESC) ctr
			FROM country c
			JOIN city ct ON c.Code = ct.CountryCode) ctpop
WHERE ctpop.ctr < 2;

-- will definitely get back to this as I learn more about SQL -- Thank you.

-- As I go along into these complex questions, I realized that complex questions doesnt mean you have to answer with complex statement --
