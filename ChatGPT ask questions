-- MySQL and ChaTGPT practice session --
-- do you know MySQL? --
-- Do you know that there are pre-loaded schemas in MySQL --
-- Do you have information on their 'world' schema --
-- Give me 5 easy example query questions from that schema, don't include the answer --

-- List all countries in the continent of Europe. --
-- Find the name and population of cities in the USA. --
-- Retrieve the names of all languages spoken in Japan. --
-- Get the name and government form of countries with a population greater than 50 million. --
-- Find all cities in Germany with a population less than 1 million. --

-- checking every table --
SELECT * FROM city;
SELECT * FROM Country;
SELECT * FROM countrylanguage;

-- Q1. List all countries in the continent of Europe. --
SELECT name FROM country
WHERE continent = 'Europe';

-- Q2. Find the name and population of cities in the USA. --
SELECT name, population FROM city
WHERE countrycode = 'USA';

-- Q3. Retrieve the names of all languages spoken in Japan. --
SELECT language FROM countrylanguage
WHERE Countrycode = 'JPN';

-- Q4. Get the name and government form of countries with a population greater than 50 million. --
SELECT name, governmentform FROM country
WHERE population > 50000000;

-- Q5. Find all cities in Germany with a population less than 1 million. --
SELECT name FROM city
WHERE countrycode = 'DEU'
AND
population < 1000000;

-- Give me 5 intermediate questions from the same schema --
-- Certainly! Here are five intermediate query questions based on the World schema: --
-- Retrieve the name of the country with the highest population. --
-- Find the top 10 countries with the largest surface area. --
-- Get the average life expectancy for each continent. --
-- List the languages spoken in each country along with the percentage of the population that speaks them. --
-- Find the capital city of the country with the highest GNP per capita. 
-- Certainly! Here are five intermediate query questions based on the World schema: --

-- Q1. Retrieve the name of the country with the highest population. --
SELECT name FROM country
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Q2. Find the top 10 countries with the largest surface area. --
SELECT name FROM country
ORDER BY SurfaceArea
LIMIT 10;

-- Q3. Get the average life expectancy for each continent. --
SELECT continent , AVG(lifeexpectancy) FROM country
GROUP BY continent;

-- Q4. List the languages spoken in each country along with the percentage of the population that speaks them. --

SELECT name Country, language, percentage FROM countrylanguage
INNER JOIN country ON countrylanguage.countrycode = country.code;

-- Q5. Find the capital city of the country with the highest GNP per capita. --

-- I think I need to break down the question to answer this one --
-- STEPS --
-- find the highest GNP per capital of the country --
SELECT name, GNP, capital, ROUND(GNP / capital, 2) AS GNPperCapital FROM country
ORDER BY GNPperCapital DESC;

-- find the city --
SELECT city.name city_name, GNP, capital, ROUND(GNP / capital, 2) AS GNPperCapital FROM city
INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
ORDER BY GNPperCapital DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- I have this one wrong, the GNP per capital needs to be GNP / population, not GNP / Capital --
-- Lesson Learned is to understand every column on the table and their purpose --
-- Capital on the country table is city ID on the city table --

-- Correct answer should be --
SELECT city.name AS city_name, country.GNP, country.capital, 
ROUND(country.GNP / country.population, 2) AS GNPperCapita 
FROM city
INNER JOIN country ON city.ID = country.capital
ORDER BY GNPperCapita DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- This Ends the Easy and Intermediate query questions from ChatGPT, I will have a separate advance query question portfolio --
